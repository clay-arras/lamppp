requirements: 
- need to export a python module: already done.
- need to figure out how to LINK the cpp .so file to the module
- finally need to figure out how to export said module WITH the pybind.
- preferrably uses poetry


ok. we want poetry to STAY as our package manager
we want to replicate the pyproject.toml and CMakeLists.txt inside of scikit_build_example
we want to install that.
